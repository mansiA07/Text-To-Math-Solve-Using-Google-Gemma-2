🧠 Text to Math Assistant + Smart Knowledge Search
Built with Streamlit + LangChain + Groq (Gemma 2)


👋 Meet Your New Math & Reasoning Assistant
Ever read a math problem and thought:

“I know this can be solved, but I wish someone could just break it down for me…”

That's exactly what this app does.

Simply type a math problem or a logic question — even in plain English — and this tool will:


Understand the intent

Solve it step-by-step, like a tutor

Or search Wikipedia for related facts if needed

No complex inputs, no math symbols, no calculators. Just natural conversation.

🧩 What Can You Do With This?


🧮 Solve math word problems

“A number is multiplied by 3 and reduced by 5. The result is 25. What’s the number?”

🔍 Search factual questions

“Who discovered the Pythagorean theorem?”
“Explain the concept of compound interest.”

🧠 Handle logic and reasoning


“If all bloops are razzies and all razzies are lizzies, are all bloops definitely lizzies?”

📊 Get point-wise explanations
Every answer comes neatly explained, step-by-step, like a mini teacher inside your browser.

🚦 How It Works Behind the Scenes


This assistant brings together:

Google's Gemma 2 model, accessed through Groq (super fast!)

LangChain agents that orchestrate tools like:

A calculator for math logic

A reasoning engine with custom prompt templates

A Wikipedia wrapper for real-time search

A clean and interactive Streamlit UI so you don’t need to code or install extra tools



🎯 Why This Project?
Because tools like ChatGPT or search engines often return:

Just the final answer with no steps

Or too much content that’s not personalized

This assistant is different:

It thinks step by step 🧠

It solves with context and logic

It answers like a real teacher


🧰 What You Need To Run It
To use this app on your own system:

Install Python and Streamlit

Paste your Groq API key into the sidebar or a .env file

Run the app with Streamlit
That’s it — no advanced setup needed.


✨ Example Prompts You Can Try
“If a number is squared and the result is 49, what is the number?”
“What is the area of a triangle with base 10 and height 5?”
“Explain Bayes' Theorem in simple steps.”
“Who created the decimal system?”

The app handles each of these gracefully — with clarity and depth.
